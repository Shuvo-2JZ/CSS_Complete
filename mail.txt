Dear Bhaia,

I am writing to share with you my plans to improve and to seek your guidance and support in achieving my goals.

I have identified the following areas where I can enhance my skills:

I want to develop my expertise in Stored Procedure as it is becoming increasingly important for our team's projects. To achieve this, I plan to practice regularly and seek the help of Protik bhai.

I also want to strengthen my knowledge in Flutter. I enrolled in Rabbil Bhai's Flutter online course two months ago and have been practicing this framework on weekends.

Finally, I plan to focus on improving my time management skills and prioritizing tasks to ensure that I can finish my projects on time.
